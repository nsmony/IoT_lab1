# Lab 1 : Temperature Sensor with Relay Control (Telegram)
This project uses an ESP32 to measure temperature and humidity with a DHT22 sensor and operate a relay module through Telegram commands.

### Equipment and Wiring
- ESP32 Dev Board (MicroPython firmware flashed)
- DHT22 sensor
- Relay module
- jumper wires
- USB cable + laptop with Thonny
- Wi-Fi access (internet)
#### Wiring Connection

#### DHT22 → ESP32
| DHT22 Pin | ESP32 Pin |
|----------|-----------|
| VCC (+) | VCC/3V3 |
| DATA (I/O) | GPIO 4 (D4) |
| GND (-) | GND |

#### Relay Module → ESP32
| Relay Pin | ESP32 Pin |
|----------|-----------|
| VCC | VCC/5V (VIN) |
| GND | GND |
| IN | GPIO 2 (D2)|

### Configuration Steps
#### 1. Telegram Bot Setup:
- Create your own telegram bot using @BotFather
- Get the generated Bot Token 
- Add your bot into your telegram group
- Get your group Chat ID

#### 2. Code Configuration:
##### Update the information into the code:
```python
BOT_TOKEN = "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
CHAT_ID = "YOUR_CHAT_ID"
```
```python
relay = Pin(2, Pin.OUT)
relay.value(0)

# -------- DHT SENSOR --------
sensor = dht.DHT22(Pin(4))
```

#### 3. Wi-Fi Credentials
```python
SSID = "YOUR_WIFI_NAME"
PASSWORD = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD"
```
#### How to Use: 
- Power the ESP32
- Connect ESP32 to Wi-Fi
- Connect ESP32 to telegram
- Use the following commands:
1. /status : to show temperature, humidity, and relay status
2. /on : to turn the relay on
3. /off : to turn the relay off
# Tasks & Checkpoints
### Task 1-Sensor Read & Print
- Read DHT22 every 5 seconds and print the temperature and humidity with 2
decimals.
- Evidence: serial screenshot.

### Task 2-Telegram Send
- Implement send_message() and post a test message to your group.
- Evidence: chat screenshot.

### Task 3-Bot Command
- Implement /status to reply with current T/H and relay state.
- Implement /on and /off to control the relay.
- Evidence: chat screenshot showing all three commands working.

### Task 4-Bot Command
- No messages while T < 30 °C.
- If T ≥ 30 °C and relay is OFF, send an alert every loop (5 s) until /on is
received.
- After /on, stop alerts. When T < 30 °C, turn relay OFF automatically and senda one-time “auto-OFF” notice.
- Evidence: short video (60–90s) demonstrating above behavior https://youtu.be/eMreX57w4FE

### Task 5-Robustness
- Auto-reconnect Wi-Fi when dropped.
- Handle Telegram HTTP errors (print status; skip this cycle on failure).
- Avoid crashing on DHT OSError (skip cycle).
